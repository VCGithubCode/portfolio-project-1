# C3MS

C3MS is a site that hopes to help educate people a tiny bit about cloud computing.  This site is targeted toward organizations looking to migrate all or part of their products into the realm of cloud computing.  Custom Complete Cloud Migration Services will be useful for people who wish to learn some information about cloud migration and possibly hire a consultant.
